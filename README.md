# Landscape For All

_Landscape For All_ is an app where a user has to log in or sign up. After login/sign-up the user can search for landscaping companies by price, location, specific tasks you need to accomplish and book them for a job. Additionally, landscaping companies can also promote their business on the app by signing up as an owner and as the owner will be able to see jobs proposed to them.
